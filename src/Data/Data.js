The list of all employees can be accessed on another page, in a table that can be organized by name, date, address, etc. To manipulate the data for this project, I used the global redux store.
    Another goal of the project is to create a React component and publish it on the NPM. 
    Lighthouse was used to test the performance of the React page to make it faster than the Jquery project.`,
